<section> <p>Louisiana Créole people are an ethnic group of people who are descendants of the colonial French settlers of Louisiana. Originally the term Créole was used in reference to anyone who was born in the colonies rather than in the homeland. The term Créole became synonymous with native peoples or those who are native born.  Louisiana Créole people share a common French heritage as well as a possibility of African, Native American, and Spanish. As time has passed Créole people have been integrated into or mixed in with other cultural groups, but this is on a person by person basis. As a whole   Louisiana Créole people have a very intricate and sophisticated society all throughout the state however, there are a few groups of them that stand out the most. In particular, there are five distinct groups: Pointe Coupee Creoles, Evangeline Parish Creoles, Avoyelles Creoles, St. Landry Creoles, and Cane River Creoles.</p>

<aside><p align="right">One of the common things that unify all of the respective Creole cultures is the francophone languages that they all share. All of the Creole cultures share French as a sort of base language, with variations and additives that are regional or cultural. Proper French is spoken throughout Louisiana, but as a whole Louisiana French (also known as colonial French) is the common language of the different Louisianan Creole people. Another such language is Louisiana Creole (also known as Kreyol La Lwizyan). This is the cultural language spoken by most if not all people who identify as Louisiana Creole. Spanish is also a language that is spoken by some of the Creole people of the state, but that is a regional thing that is determined by the groups of people in any given parish or area.</p></aside>
