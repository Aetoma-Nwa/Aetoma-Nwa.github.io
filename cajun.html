     <section> <p>Cajun is a word that refers to an ethnic group of people who are immigrants from an area in   Canada that was known as Acadia. They were pushed out of their homeland around 1756 in an event that came to be known as The Great Expulsion. They used to live in an area that is now modern day Nova Scotia, as well as parts of eastern Quebec and northern Maine. After the Great Expulsion they later settled in different parts of southern Louisiana. After the end of the American Revolutionary War, about 1,500 more Acadians arrived in New Orleans. About 3,000 Acadians had been deported to France during the Great expulsion. In 1785, about 1,500 were authorized to emigrate to Louisiana, often to be reunited with their families, or because they could not settle in France.</p>

<aside><p align="right">When Cajuns migrated to Louisiana they developed their own dialect of French that is now commonly referred to as Cajun French. Recently the Younger generation of Cajuns have created a patwa that is called Cajun English. This patwa is being integrated into their everyday culture.</p></aside>
