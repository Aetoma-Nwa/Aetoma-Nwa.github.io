       <section> <p>There were three major moments where Haitian people migrated from their homeland to areas of America. One such migration happened around 1804 when Haitian people won their independence from French colonization. This revolution disrupted much of the current economy, and caused many wealthy French and Haitian people invested in that economy to migrate to other parts of the world. One of many destinations for these different groups of people was the already established francophone area of Louisiana as well as parts of Florida. Another major event that caused a mass migration of Haitian people happened between 1977 and 1981, when Duvalierâ€™s rule over Haiti resulted in the murder of 30,000 to 60,000 Haitians and the exile of so many more. In this instance, the Haitian immigrants settled into different areas of Florida, New York, and new Jersey. In the late 20th century there was yet another   mass migration of the Haitian professional middle class seeking political asylum and an opportunity for a better future.  </p>

         <aside><p align="right">Haitian people Speak a specific dialect of creole that is referred to as Haitian Creole. Most of the Haitian people who have migrated to America speak English as their second language. Depending on the region that they have moved into they might also speak other languages that are prevalent in that area as well.</p>
